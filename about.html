        <p>Growing up, I played a lot of video games, read a lot of books, and enjoyed solving the occasional puzzle or riddle.
            The more games I played, the more I wanted to be part of creating one. Before COVID I was a bartender, and once the bars shut down
            I was left with a lot of time to figure out what I should do next. I always wanted to give coding a chance, so I looked into programs
            for coding camps. I found Per Scholas Pittsburgh, applied and got in. It was pretty challenging but I graduated with a workable project
            and a month later I had a job as a software developer at a bank.</p>
