        <p>Growing up, I played a lot of video games, read a lot of books, and enjoyed solving the occasional puzzle or riddle.
            The more games I played, the more I wanted to be part of creating one. Before COVID I was a bartender, and once the bars shut down
            I was left with a lot of time to figure out what I should do next. I always wanted to give coding a chance, so I looked into programs
            for coding camps. I found Per Scholas Pittsburgh, applied and got in. It was pretty challenging but I graduated with a workable project
            and a month later I had a job as a software developer at a bank.</p>

        <p>The of the biggest mistakes of my career as a professional is two-fold. One, I entertained career paths that I knew I didn't enjoy
            and in some cases actively hated. One example I can think of is my brief time in sales. Everything I learned about how to make a sales
            and getting people to talk to you made me deeply uncomfortable. I didn't like any of the behaviors needed to be successful being used on
            me which meant I didn't like using them on people either. Second, I made some decisions and took advice out of desperation.
            When you have bills to pay, or you want to be able to do things with friends or family but can't, you really open your mind up to more 
            than you normally would. I took advice to try careers and positions that made me uncomfortable, and I made a lot of hasty and 
            misinformed decisions. My first sales job is an example of this. My previous position had no advancement opportunities and the money was 
            lacking even after a significant raise. I was desperate for something that would allow growth and advancement and I started not to care
            where I got it. That did lead to me getting a 100% commission job that shut down within 8 months, and I had to rely on my bartending job 
            on the weekends.</p>

        <p>My biggest weakness is thinking I understand a problem fully from the start and not asking questions. I know that's two, but they kinda
            come as a package. Very often I'll understand exactly what problem is being explained to me, and feel confident I correctly diagnosed
            the problem on the spot. Now, I know that's probably not true and will need some time exploring the problem so I can ask specific questions
            if there aren't any obvious ones. Then? That wasn't a thing. So I would start working on an issue and inevitably come across the thing I
            didn't think to ask about and I could move on from there. This doesn't seem like a huge problem, and it wasn't in terms of solving the issue,
            but it took up much more time than was necessary. Had I asked even 2 more questions, I might have saved an hour or two. So, my biggest weakness
            is actually time in the form of not asking questions.
